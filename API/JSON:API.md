JSON:API is a specification for tailoring APIs that respond in JSON. Its purpose is to take the API `design` out of the equation so that developers can focus on API `delivery`. Due to its structure, tooling can be built around the specification which handles the bulk of work regarding parsing requests and formatting responses.

If your work consists of building or working with JSON:API APIs, read the [specification](https://jsonapi.org/) to understand the concepts behind it.
