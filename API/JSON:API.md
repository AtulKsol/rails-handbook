JSON:API is a specification for formatting JSON APIs. Its purpose is to take API format design out of the equation so that you can focus on delivering your API. Due to its structure, tooling can be built around the specification which handles the bulk of work regarding parsing requests and formatting responses.

The specification can be found [here](https://jsonapi.org/). If your work will concern building or working with JSON:API APIs, read the specification to understand the concepts behind it.
